	  <h2>About me</h2>
	  <p>Hi all, I am Kevin Young and this is my agile web page. I am a student at CVTC taking the 
	    Information Technology - Software Developer course. I live in Eau Claire and am married. 
	    My wife is from the Philippines and going to meet her for the first time was an interesting 
	    experience. We have a terrific little boy who is 4 years old.
	  </p>
	  <p>Along with the Agile class I am also taking the Capstone. This is a course to create a final 
	    project working with a team. Last year while watching my son play a memory game on the computer 
		I had an idea for a program. At the time I did not feel skilled enough to make it. At the start 
		of the Capstone class we were asked to list ideas for projects to work on. To my surprise four 
		other students liked the idea. Unfortunately that made our group to big so one had to take a 
		different project.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are several parts to this idea. A memory game, a math game, and a language game. At this time 
	    we chose to focus on the memory game. The idea was to create a memory game that people could add their 
		own images to along with a caption. Then when their child played the game they would be able to see an 
		image and start relating the caption to that image. One of the other members had a great idea to add to 
		that. When a match is made a message would pop-up saying "Congratulations you found " then the caption 
		would appear one letter at a time.
